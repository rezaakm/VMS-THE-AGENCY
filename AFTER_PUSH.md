# After pushing to GitHub

The full combined project is now on **https://github.com/rezaakm/VMS-THE-AGENCY**.

## 1. Verify on GitHub

- Open https://github.com/rezaakm/VMS-THE-AGENCY
- Check that you see: `packages/`, `cost-intelligence-system/`, `vendor_system/`, `server.js`, `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.

## 2. (Optional) Clone elsewhere

If you want the repo on another PC or folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezaakm/VMS-THE-AGENCY.git
cd VMS-THE-AGENCY
```

Then run the main VMS from the new location (see README.md).

## 3. Delete from desktop

When you are sure everything is on GitHub and you don’t need the desktop copy:

1. Close any apps (Cursor, terminals) that are using the folder.
2. Delete the folder **VMS - THE AGENCY** from your Desktop (e.g. right‑click → Delete, or move to Recycle Bin).

You can always get the project again with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezaakm/VMS-THE-AGENCY.git
```
